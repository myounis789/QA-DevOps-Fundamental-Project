## Project Brief:

The brief for this project was to design and produce a CRUD application. The needs to execute the following functions:
CREATE
READ
UPDATE
DELETE

It needs to be connected to an SQL database with atleast one one-to-many database relationsip

Before I start, I planned out my project requirements:

## App Design:
These are the software flowcharts for my app design:

This is how the customer login and features would work including CRUD:

## Risk Assessment:
Thefollowing risks were identified:


# The App:
Here are some screenshots of my application:


## Known Issues:

- There is nothing to stop two options for the same question being assigned the same letter
- Submitted answers are not cleared post-quiz unless the user clicks the 'return to home' link.

## Future Work:

In future sprints, in addition to fixing the issues identified above, I would like to add a statistics page which provides a break-down of results over time by quiz. If the appropriate security measures were adhered to, future sprints could also reconsider adding user profiles which would allow users to view and write quizzes specific to them.
